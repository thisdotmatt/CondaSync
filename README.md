> Automatic Dependency Tracker

Most package managers, such as npm and yarn, update your dependency files the moment you make any changes to your environment. Conda (surprisingly) **does not**. Existing solutions require you to manually update your dependency list, which is tedious and prone to errors. 
<br><br>
CondaSync is a simple Visual Studio Code Extension that integrates directly into your environment and does the boring work for you.

### Features
- Track a conda environment through its entire life cycle with one command
